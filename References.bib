Major parameter considered for {AQI} computation are {NO}, {NO}2, {NOx}, {SO}2, Ambient temperature, relative humidity, bar pressure, solar radiation, wind speed, wind direction, benzene, toluene, xylene, {PM}2.5 and rack temperature. An approach to assess and represent air quality status through an Air Quality Index ({AQI}), in Hyderabad city is done by representing the variation of {AQI} with a multivariate regression model. The utility of this study lies for major metropolitan cities, where different types of activities, viz. industrial, commercial and residential are in progress, on a short and a long term basis this model can be useful for better forecasting of air quality parameters. To make the index more informative, air quality status is classified into five different categories, viz. Clean, Moderate, Poor, Bad and Dangerous. Long term air quality indices are then calculated using hourly basis data for Hyderabad city which is a metropolitan city of India and is fast developing in terms of different climatologically defined features. The included application of this formal analysis includes accounting for atmospheric processes, ambient measurements, emissions characterization, air quality modeling of emissions to ambient concentrations, and characterization of human and ecological responses to ambient pollutant exposure. There is a need for new management strategy that would expand the current practice of accountability that relates emission reductions and attainment of air quality derived from air quality criteria and standards. Conceptually, achievement of accountability would establish goals optimizing risk reduction associated with pollution management.},

Driven by the increasing awareness of the health aspects of air pollution exposure, especially by most sensitive sub–populations such as children and the elderly, short–term air pollution forecasts are being provided more and more by local authorities. The Air Quality Index ({AQI}) is a number used by governmental agencies to characterize the quality of the air at a given location. {AQI} is used for local and regional air quality management in many metropolitan cities of the world. The main objective of the present study is to forecast short–term daily {AQI} through previous day’s {AQI} and meteorological variables using principal component regression ({PCR}) technique. This study has been made for four different seasons namely summer, monsoon, post monsoon and winter. {AQI} was estimated for the period of seven years from 2000–2006 at {ITO} (a busiest traffic intersection) for criteria pollutants such as respirable suspended particulate matter ({RSPM}), sulfur dioxide ({SO}2), nitrogen dioxide ({NO}2) and suspended particulate matter ({SPM}) using a method of {US} Environmental Protection Agency ({USEPA}), in which sub–index and breakpoint pollutant concentration depends on Indian National Ambient Air Quality Standard ({NAAQS}). The Principal components have been computed using covariance of input data matrix. Only those components, having eigenvalues ≥1, were used to predict the {AQI} using principal component regression technique. The performance of {PCR} model, used for forecasting of {AQI}, was better in winter than the other seasons as studied through statistical error analysis. The values of normalized mean square error ({NMSE}) were found as 0.0058, 0.0082, 0.0241 and 0.0418 for winter, summer, post monsoon and monsoon respectively. The other statistical parameters are also supporting the same result.},

	abstract = {Pollution concentrations in urban areas are primarily from vehicular exhaust, factories, and small scale industries. Recent studies conducted by the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute ({SMHI}) says that 3000-5000 premature deaths [2] occur every year as a result of inhaling a high level of pollution concentrations like {PM}10, {PM}2.5, {CO}, Nitrogen Oxides ({NO}+{NO}2). A sustainable lifestyle in an urban city-like environment is thus possible only through smart city style urban management. Foreseeing the future, the Uppsala Municipality along with the help of {IBM}, Ericsson, and the Uppsala University has initiated a smart city project in Uppsala. The thrust of this initiative would be deploying pollution detection sensors all over Uppsala city and monitoring pollution concentrations continuously throughout the day. The data collected will then be passed to a knowledge discovery process that would forecast pollution concentration for the future, and will be presented in a user-friendly format in real-time using an Android application. This application will provide users with real-time pollution concentration level along with the predicted value of the location thereby helping in raising awareness of its causes and consequences. The main focus of this thesis will be in exploring the suitable data mining technique that will help in better forecasting of the pollution concentration. In addition to the data model, it also focuses on the design and implementation of an Android application targeted towards the people of Uppsala community.},

The air quality indices revealed the air quality unhealthy during the summer and winter. Ensemble models were constructed to discriminate between the seasonal air qualities, factors responsible for discrimination, and to predict the air quality indices. Accordingly, single decision tree ({SDT}), decision tree forest ({DTF}), and decision treeboost ({DTB}) were constructed and their generalization and predictive performance was evaluated in terms of several statistical parameters and compared with conventional machine learning benchmark, support vector machines ({SVM}). The {DT} and {SVM} models discriminated the seasonal air quality rendering misclassification rate ({MR}) of 8.32\% ({SDT}); 4.12\% ({DTF}); 5.62\% ({DTB}), and 6.18\% ({SVM}), respectively in complete data.

	abstract = {The World Health Organization estimates that particulate matter ({PM}) air pollution contributes to approximately 800,000 premature deaths each year, ranking it the 13th leading cause of mortality worldwide. However, many studies show that the relationship is deeper and far more complicated than originally thought. {PM} is a portion of air pollution that is made up of extremely small particles and liquid droplets containing acids, organic chemicals, metals, and soil or dust particles. {PM} is categorized by size and continues to be the fraction of air pollution that is most reliably associated with human disease. {PM} is thought to contribute to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease by the mechanisms of systemic inflammation, direct and indirect coagulation activation, and direct translocation into systemic circulation. The data demonstrating {PM}'s effect on the cardiovascular system are strong. Populations subjected to long-term exposure to {PM} have a significantly higher cardiovascular incident and mortality rate. Short-term acute exposures subtly increase the rate of cardiovascular events within days of a pollution spike. The data are not as strong for {PM}'s effects on cerebrovascular disease, though some data and similar mechanisms suggest a lesser result with smaller amplitude. Respiratory diseases are also exacerbated by exposure to {PM}. {PM} causes respiratory morbidity and mortality by creating oxidative stress and inflammation that leads to pulmonary anatomic and physiologic remodeling. The literature shows {PM} causes worsening respiratory symptoms, more frequent medication use, decreased lung function, recurrent health care utilization, and increased mortality. {PM} exposure has been shown to have a small but significant adverse effect on cardiovascular, respiratory, and to a lesser extent, cerebrovascular disease. These consistent results are shown by multiple studies with varying populations, protocols, and regions. The data demonstrate a dose-dependent relationship between {PM} and human disease, and that removal from a {PM}-rich environment decreases the prevalence of these diseases. While further study is needed to elucidate the effects of composition, chemistry, and the {PM} effect on susceptible populations, the preponderance of data shows that {PM} exposure causes a small but significant increase in human morbidity and mortality. Most sources agree on certain “common sense” recommendations, although there are lonely limited data to support them. Indoor {PM} exposure can be reduced by the usage of air conditioning and particulate filters, decreasing indoor combustion for heating and cooking, and smoking cessation. Susceptible populations, such as the elderly or asthmatics, may benefit from limiting their outdoor activity during peak traffic periods or poor air quality days. These simple changes may benefit individual patients in both short-term symptomatic control and long-term cardiovascular and respiratory complications.},

In terms of accuracy, however, multiple regression analysis is insufficient for analyzing atmospheric environment data in South Korea. In addition, although the time series analysis technique is appropriate for analyzing linear data, it is inappropriate for analyzing atmospheric environment data in South Korea, where linear and nonlinear data are mixed. Therefore, this study proposes a seasonal auto regressive integrated moving average–support vector machine ({SARIMA}–{SVM}) time series analysis algorithm, combining time series analysis and nonlinear analysis, for data analysis of atmospheric environment information and improvement of pollution forecast accuracy. The proposed algorithm analyzes the seasonality in environmental contamination by using the {SARIMA} model, and succeeds in improving accuracy in the contamination forecast through an analysis of linear and nonlinear characteristics by applying an {SVM} nonlinear regression model. A comparative assessment with the existing atmospheric contamination forecast algorithm was conducted as well. The assessment results show that the forecast accuracy of the proposed algorithm improved by 20.81\% for fine dust, and by 43.77\% for ozone, compared to the performance of the existing models.},

	abstract = {Urbanization, industrialization, and regional economic integration have developed rapidly in China in recent years. Air pollution has attracted more and more attention. However, {PM}2.5 is the main particulate matter in air pollution. Therefore, how to predict {PM}2.5 accurately and effectively has become a concern of experts and scholars. For the problem, atmosphere {PM}2.5 concentration prediction algorithm is proposed based on time series and interactive multiple model in this paper. {PM}2.5 concentration is collected by using the monitor at different air quality levels. The time series models are established by historical {PM}2.5 concentration data, which were given by the autoregressive model ({AR}). In the paper, three {PM}2.5 time series models are established for three different air quality levels. Then, the three models are converted to state equation, respectively, by autoregressive integrated with Kalman filter ({AR}-Kalman) approaches. Besides, the proposed interactive multiple model ({IMM}) algorithm is, respectively, compared with autoregressive ({AR}) model algorithm and {AR}-Kalman prediction algorithm. It is turned out the proposed {IMM} algorithm is more accurate than the other two approaches for {PM}2.5 prediction, and it is effective.},

	abstract = {There is increasingly growing evidence linking urban air pollution to acute and chronic illnesses amongst all age groups. Therefore, monitoring of ambient concentrations of various air pollutants as well as quantification of the dose inhaled becomes quite important, specially in view of the fact that in many countries, policy decisions for reducing pollutant concentrations are mainly taken on the basis of their health impacts. The dose when gets combined with the likely responses, indicates the ultimate health risk ({HR}). Thus, as an extension of our earlier studies, {HR} has been estimated for three pollutants, namely, suspended particulate matter ({SPM}), nitrogen dioxide ({NO}2) and sulfur dioxide ({SO}2) for Delhi City in India. For estimation and analyses, three zones have been considered, namely, residential, industrial and commercial. The total population has been divided into three age classes (infants, children and adults) with different body weights and breathing rates. The exercise takes into account age-specific breathing rates, body weights for different age categories and occupancy factors for different zones. Results indicate that health risks due to air pollution in Delhi are highest for children. For all age categories, health risks due to {SO}2 ({HR}\_SO2) are the lowest. Hence, {HR}\_SO2 has been taken as the reference with respect to which {HR} values due to {SPM} and {NO}2 have been compared. Taking into account all the age categories and their occupancy in different zones, average {HR} values for {NO}2 and {SPM} turn out to be respectively 22.11 and 16.13 times more than that for {SO}2. The present study can be useful in generating public awareness as well as in averting and mitigating the health risks.},

	doi = {10.1109/JSEN.2016.2514378},
	abstract = {A system for monitoring and forecasting urban air pollution is presented in this paper. The system uses low-cost air-quality monitoring motes that are equipped with an array of gaseous and meteorological sensors. These motes wirelessly communicate to an intelligent sensing platform that consists of several modules. The modules are responsible for receiving and storing the data, preprocessing and converting the data into useful information, forecasting the pollutants based on historical information, and finally presenting the acquired information through different channels, such as mobile application, Web portal, and short message service. The focus of this paper is on the monitoring system and its forecasting module. Three machine learning ({ML}) algorithms are investigated to build accurate forecasting models for one-step and multi-step ahead of concentrations of ground-level ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide ({NO}2), and sulfur dioxide ({SO}2). These {ML} algorithms are support vector machines, M5P model trees, and artificial neural networks ({ANN}). Two types of modeling are pursued: 1) univariate and 2) multivariate. The performance evaluation measures used are prediction trend accuracy and root mean square error ({RMSE}). The results show that using different features in multivariate modeling with M5P algorithm yields the best forecasting performances. For example, using M5P, {RMSE} is at its lowest, reaching 31.4, when hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is used to predict {SO}2. Contrarily, the worst performance, i.e., {RMSE} of 62.4, for {SO}2 is when using {ANN} in univariate modeling. The outcome of this paper can be significantly useful for alarming applications in areas with high air pollution levels.},

With local authority maintained monitoring stations being geographically sparse and the resultant datasets also featuring missing labels, computational data-driven mechanisms are needed to address the data sparsity challenge. In this paper, we propose a machine learning-based method to accurately predict the air quality index, using environmental monitoring data together with meteorological measurements. To do so, we develop an air quality estimation framework that implements a neural network that is enhanced with a novel non-linear autoregressive neural network with exogenous input model, especially designed for time series prediction. The framework is applied to a case study featuring different monitoring sites in London, with comparisons against other standard machine-learning-based predictive algorithms showing the feasibility and robust performance of the proposed method for different kinds of areas within an urban region.},
