First and Foremost, I praise Almighty God for giving me this beautiful life full of oppurtunities and for always being there with me in my times of joys and sorrow.

I would like to express my deep and sincere thanks to \textbf{Dr. Twinkle R. Singh} for her continuous support of my project work. She motivated me, provided valuable guidance and gave stimulating suggestions which were instrumental in successful completion of my project work and writing of this dissertation.

It gives me immense pleasure to record the love and affection towards my family, especially to my parents for their blessings, inspiration and well wishes in my life. I would like to thank my brother for his support and help through every phase of my life.

I have always been fortunate to be in the company of wonderful and caring friends,who have been a great source of joy for me, specially \textbf{Aniruddha Deshmukh, Sumeet Kumar, Soumit Jana} and \textbf{Abhishek Kumar} for their companionship during difficult times.
